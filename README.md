# Save the Children Icons

This project aims to create a standard set of icons for Save the Children, using easily scalable vector graphics.

## Getting Started

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/savethechildren/icon-font/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/savethechildren/icon-font.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install savethechildren/icon-font`
- Install with [Bower](https://bower.io): `bower install savethechildren/icon-font`

Copy the dist/js directory into your project. In your HTML, reference the location to your stc-icons.js.

You can then use the icon classes in your HTML code:

`<i class="fstc fa-circle"></i>`

This extends the default FontAwesome icons, see [the FontAwesome documentation](https://fontawesome.com/start) for more.

You can view the list of available icons by opening the index.html file.
